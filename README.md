# Activity Helper

> 小程序已于2020年上线，大家可搜索`BJUT活动助手`访问到本程序。但由于未能与校方进一步合作，本程序已于2021年6月不再进行数据更新。因程序内不显示过期活动，导致当前可访问数据较少(约等于0)。
>
> 如果你访问这个项目，是用于学习小程序开发，笔者是不建议的。因为该项目是我第一次接触小程序开发时的实践产物，其中有许多架构和细节上的冗余与矛盾。
>
> 推荐大家先过完一遍js基础后，从个人实践中走出自己的一条路来。加油！

### P.S. 毕设版介绍

  The information explosion brought about by the digital age has made all kinds of information rich and easy to obtain, while also increasing the difficulty of information screening and filtering effective information. Since most of the activities carried out in colleges and universities are relatively independently managed by different student organizations, the information resources of campus activities are numerous and mixed. 
  
  In order to eliminate information islands, this article designs and develops an activity information service platform: the platform is based on WeChat applet development, and the target users are student organizations and ordinary students. The platform provides a unified activity release management function for student organizations, and also provides diversified services such as intelligent recommendation, comment, subscription, registration, check-in, collection, and sharing of activity information for school students. 
  
  The innovation and application value of the platform are: ①Providing a design plan for the whole process control of activities from publicity to closing, online and offline integration for student organizations that hold activities, eliminating the original scattered information and no unified management tools Difficulties; ② through the sharing of basic data in the campus cloud platform to simplify the use process, improve user experience and activity execution efficiency. ③Draw user preference portraits based on user usage data, and make one-to-one accurate activity recommendations for students. 
  
  In recent years, the campus activity information service platform has a relatively extensive theoretical research foundation, but fewer products have been developed and implemented. At present, there is no more prominent similar product on the market. Therefore, the products designed in this article have a certain reference significance for the construction of smart campus and the construction of mobile informatization in colleges and universities.
